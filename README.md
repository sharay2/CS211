# OpenStreetMaps
This is a school project that acts as a simple navigation app for UIC.
It will read a file that holds the coordinates of each building at UIC, and the walkways between them.

As the user, you have to type in two buildings, and the program will find the building closest to the 
midpoint between them, and return the coordinates of the destination as well as the coordinates of the
walkways to get there.

This project uses a multitude of ADTs, and utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the walkways to the
midpoints.
